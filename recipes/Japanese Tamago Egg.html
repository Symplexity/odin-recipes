        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tamago (a.k.a. tamagoyaki) is a Japanese omelet. Itâ€™s made by rolling together thin
            layers of fried eggs, then slicing the log into rectangles. Since the egg is mixed with
            dashi, sugar, and mirin, the finished product has a complex and subtly sweet flavor.
            Tamago is traditionally served for breakfast or as a sushi ingredient.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Four eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup prepared dashi stock</li>
            <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mirin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, sugar, mirin, and soy sauce
                until sugar has dissolved. Lightly grease a nonstick skillet and heat over medium
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat the pan. Cook
                until egg layer is firm on the bottom but still slightly liquid on top, about 1
                minute.
            </li>
            <li>Then lift up one edge using a spatula and roll up the egg layer.</li>
            <li>
                Push omelet roll to one side of the skillet. Oil the skillet again and pour in
                another thin layer of egg, lifting the first omelet roll up slightly to allow the
                egg to flow underneath.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge of the
                skillet as before.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture, oiling the pan each time if
                needed.
            </li>
            <li>Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to serve.</li>
        </ol>
